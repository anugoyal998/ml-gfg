# Understanding Data Processing
Data Processing is the task of converting data from a given form to a much more usable and desired form i.e. making it more meaningful and informative. Using Machine Learning algorithms, mathematical modeling, and statistical knowledge, this entire process can be automated. The output of this complete process can be in any desired form like graphs, videos, charts, tables, images, and many more, depending on the task we are performing and the requirements of the machine. This might seem to be simple but when it comes to massive organizations like Twitter, Facebook, Administrative bodies like Parliament, UNESCO, and health sector organizations, this entire process needs to be performed in a very structured manner. So, the steps to perform are as follows:
