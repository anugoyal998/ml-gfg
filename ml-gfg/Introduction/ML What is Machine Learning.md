# ML | What is Machine Learning ?

**Arthur Samuel**, a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence and computer gaming, coined the term **“Machine Learning”**. He defined machine learning as – **“Field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed”**.

**In a very layman manner, Machine Learning(ML) can be explained as automating and improving the learning process of computers based on their experiences without being actually programmed i.e. without any human assistance.**


### Basic Difference in ML and Traditional Programming?

* `Traditional Programming` : We feed in DATA (Input) + PROGRAM (logic), run it on machine and get output.
* `Machine Learning` : We feed in DATA(Input) + Output, run it on machine during training and the machine creates its own program(logic), which can be evaluated while testing.

**ML in health care** : Researchers and scientists have prepared models to train machines for detecting cancer just by looking at slide – cell images. For humans to perform this task it would have taken a lot of time. But now, no more delay, machines predict the chances of having or not having cancer with some accuracy and doctors just have to give an assurance call, that’s it. The answer to – how is this possible is very simple -all that is required, is, high computation machine, a large amount of good quality image data, ML model with good algorithms to achieve state-of-the-art results.
Doctors are using ML even to diagnose patients based on different parameters under consideration.
