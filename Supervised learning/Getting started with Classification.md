# Getting started with Classification

As the name suggests, Classification is the task of “classifying things” into sub-categories.

#### Types of Classification

* `Binary Classification`: When we have to categorize given data into 2 distinct classes.
* `Multiclass Classification`: The number of classes is more than 2. For Example – On the basis of data about different species of flowers, we have to determine which specie does our observation belongs to.
