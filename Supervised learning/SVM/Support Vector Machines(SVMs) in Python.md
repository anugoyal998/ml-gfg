# Support Vector Machines(SVMs) in Python

In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis.
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane. In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples.

**What is Support Vector Machine?**
An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible.
In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.

Letâ€™s have a quick example of support vector classification. First we need to create a dataset:

```
# importing scikit learn with make_blobs
from sklearn.datasets.samples_generator import make_blobs

# creating datasets X containing n_samples
# Y containing two classes
X, Y = make_blobs(n_samples=500, centers=2,
				random_state=0, cluster_std=0.40)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# plotting scatters
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=Y, s=50, cmap='spring');
plt.show()
```

```
# creating line space between -1 to 3.5
xfit = np.linspace(-1, 3.5)

# plotting scatter
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=Y, s=50, cmap='spring')

# plot a line between the different sets of data
for m, b, d in [(1, 0.65, 0.33), (0.5, 1.6, 0.55), (-0.2, 2.9, 0.2)]:
	yfit = m * xfit + b
	plt.plot(xfit, yfit, '-k')
	plt.fill_between(xfit, yfit - d, yfit + d, edgecolor='none',
	color='#AAAAAA', alpha=0.4)

plt.xlim(-1, 3.5);
plt.show()
```
