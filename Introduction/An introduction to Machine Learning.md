# An introduction to Machine Learning

`Machine Learning (Some bookish definations)`: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. 

Let’s try to understand Machine Learning in layman’s terms.

Consider you are trying to toss a paper into a dustbin. After the first attempt, you realize that you have put too much force into it. After the second attempt, you realize you are closer to the target but you need to increase your throw angle. What is happening here is basically after every throw we are learning something and improving the end result. We are programmed to learn from our experience.
