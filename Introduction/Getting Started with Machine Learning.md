# Getting Started with Machine Learning

* `Supervised learning`: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a “teacher”, and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. The training process continues until the model achieves the desired level of accuracy on the training data. 

* `Unsupervised learning`: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. It is used for clustering population in different groups.

A simple diagram which clears the concept of supervised and unsupervised learning is shown below:

* `Reinforcement learning`: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). The program is provided feedback in terms of rewards and punishments as it navigates its problem space.

* `Dimensionality reduction`: It simplifies inputs by mapping them into a lower-dimensional space. Topic modeling is a related problem, where a program is given a list of human language documents and is tasked to find out which documents cover similar topics. **(Didn't get it? Don't worry we will discuss it later)**

**Some commonly used machine learning algorithms are Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM(Support vector machines), Naive Bayes, KNN(K nearest neighbors), K-Means, Random Forest, etc.**
